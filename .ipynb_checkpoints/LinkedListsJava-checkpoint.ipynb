    "In most cases, we will use the head node (the first node) to represent the whole list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations\n",
    "Unlike the array, we can't access a random element in a singly-linekd list in constant time. If we want to get the i'th element, we have to traverse from the head node one by one. It takes us O(N) time on average to visit an element by index, where N is the length of the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "So why is the linked list useful though it has such bad performance compared to the array in accessing data by index? The insert and delete operations!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Add Operation - Singly Linked List\n",
    "If we awant to add a new value after a given node **prev**, we should:\n",
    "    1. Initialize a new node **curr** with the given value\n",
    "   \n",
    "    2. Link the \"next\" field of curr to prev's next node **next**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Link the \"next\" field in prev to curr. \n",
    "    \n",
    "Unlike an array, we don't need to move all elements past the inserted element. Therefore you can insert a node into a linked list in O(1) time. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Add a Node at the beginning\n",
    "As we know, we use the head node **head** to represent the whole list.\n",
    "So, its necessary to update head when adding a new node at the beginning of the list.\n",
    "    1. Initialize a new node curr\n",
    "    2. Link the new node to our original head node head\n",
    "    3. Assign curr to head.\n",
    "    \n",
    "For ex: lets add a new node 9 to the beginning of the list.\n",
    "    1. We initialize new node 9\n",
    "    2. We link node 9 \"next\" to current head node.\n",
    "    3. Assign node 9 to be our new head.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What about adding a new node at the end of the list? Can we still use a similar strategy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Delete Operation - Singly Linked List\n",
    "If we want to delete an existing node curr from the singly linked list, we can do it in two steps:\n",
    "    1. Find curr's previous node **prev** and its next node **next**\n",
    "    2. Link **prev** to **curr's** next node **next**.\n",
    "In the first step, we need to find out **prev** and **next**. It's easy to find out next using the reference field of curr, however, wehave to traverse the linked lsit from the head node to find out **prev** which will take O(N) time on average, where N is the length of the linked list. So, the time complexity of deleting a node will be O(N).\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity is O(1) because we only need constant space to store our pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example delete:\n",
    "Say we have singly linked list: 23 -> 6 -> 15 -> None\n",
    "Let's try to delete node 6:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Traverse the linked list from head until we find the previous node **prev** which is node 23. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Link **prev** (node 23) with **next** (node 15)\n",
    "\n",
    "Node 6 is no longer in our singly linked list. You could even link 6's next to null if you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Delete the First Node:\n",
    "If we want to delete the first node, the strategy will be a little different.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to delete the first node, we can simply **assign the next node to head**. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Design Singly Linked List\n",
    "Design your implementation of th linkd list. A node in a linked list should have two attributes: val and next. **val** is the value of the current node, and **next** is a pointer to the next node. \n",
    "\n",
    "Implement these functions in your linked list class:\n",
    "- **get(index)**: Get the value of the index-th node in the linked list. If the index is invalid, return -1\n",
    "- **addAtHead(val)**: Add a node of value val before the first element of the linked list. After the insertion, the new noe will be the first node of the linked list.\n",
    "- **addAtTail(val)**: Append a node of value val to the last element of the linked list.\n",
    "- **addAtIndex(index, val)**: Add a node of value val before the index-th node in the linked list. If index equals to the length of the linked list, the node will be appended to the end of the linked list. If the index is greater than the length, the node will not be inserted.\n",
    "- **deleteAtIndex(index)**: Delete the index-th node in the linked list, if the index is valid. \n"
