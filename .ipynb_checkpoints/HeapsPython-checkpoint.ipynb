    "# Min Heap in Python\n",
    "A Min-Heap is a complete binary tree where the value in each internal node is smaller than or equal to the values in the children of that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mapping the elements of a heap into an array is simple: If a node is stored in index k, then the left child is stored at index 2k+1, and its right child at index 2k + 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of Min Heap:\n",
    "        5\n",
    "      /   \\\n",

    "### How is a Min Heap represented?\n",
    "A Min Heap is a complete binary tree. It's typically represented as an array. The root is at Arr[0]. For any ith node, Arr[i]:\n",
    "* Arr[(i - 1)/2] : returns its parent node.\n",
    "* Arr[(2 * i) + 1] : returns its left child node.\n",
    "* Arr[(2 * i) + 2] : returns its right child node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations on Min Heap:\n",
    "1. getMin(): Returns the root element of Min Heap in constant time.\n",
    "2. extractMin(): Removes the minimum element from minHeap. Because the minHeap has to maintain the heap structure, the time compleixty is O(log n).\n",
    "3. insert(): Inserting a new key takes O(log n) time because we add a new key at the end of the tree then it traverses up to fix the violated heap property.\n",
    "\n",
