    "# Heaps\n",
    "## What is a heap? What are the different kinds?\n",
    "A heap is a data structure based on trees in which all the nodes of the tree are in a specific order. \n",
    "\n",
    "The max number of children of a node in a heap depends on the type of heap. In the more commonly-used heap type, there are max 2 children per node, this is known as a Binary heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a binary heap, if the heap is a complete binary tree with N nodes, then it has a smallest possible height of log(N).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main kinds of heaps: MinHeap and MaxHeap. They differ by the order of the values from the root node. In a MaxHeap the root node will be the highest value node, and vice versa for the MinHeap.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note: An array can be used to simulate a tree. If we are storing one element at index i in array Arr, then its parent will be stored at index (i-1)/2 (unless its a root, a root has no parent) and can be accessed by Arr[i-1/2], and the left child can be accessed by Arr[(2*i) + 1], and the right child can be accessed by Arr[2*i+2]. The index of root will be 0 in an array.   Arr = [6, 4, 5, 3, 2, 0, 1]\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Max Heap\n",
    "In this type of heap, the value of the parent node will always be greater than or equal to the value of the child node across the tree, and the node with the highest value will be the root node of the tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical operations on Max Heap:\n",
    "1. getMax(): Returns the root element of Max Heap. Time complexity of this operation is O(1).\n",
    "2. extractMax(): Removes the max element from MaxHeap. Time complexity is O(log n) because it needs to maintain the heap property after removing root.\n",
    "3. Insert(): Inserting a new key takes O(log n) time. We add a new key at the end of the tree. If the new key is smaller than it's parent then we don't need to do anything. Otherwise, we need to traverse up to fix the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementation: Note: I index from 1 to simplify the implementation."
