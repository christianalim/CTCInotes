    "# Binary Trees\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "A tree is a data structure used to simulate, well... a tree. You can think of it as a hierarchical structure consisting of nodes that connect to other nodes in a parent/descendant kind of way. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **binary tree** is a tree data structure in which each node has **at most two children**, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common type of binary tree is a binary search tree, where every node has a value greater than or equal to the node values in the left sub-tree, and less than or equal to the node values in the right sub-tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation:\n",
    "A binary tree consists of nodes, so we'll have to make a Node class first, which takes a value and has left and right Nodes. This is going to be a binary search tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Operations:\n",
    "#### Inserting Elements:\n",
    "To insert an element, we're going to need to locate where we want to add a new node to keep the tree sorted. These are the following rules from the root node:\n",
    "* if the new node's value is lower than the current node's, we go to the left child\n",
    "* if the new node's value is greater than the current node's, we go to the right child.\n",
    "* when the current node is null, we've reached a leaf node and we can insert the new node in that position\n",
    "\n",
    "So first, we'll create a recursive method to do the insertion, #addRecursive. Next, we create the public method that starts the recursion from the **root** node. #add.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can use this method to create the tree from our example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finding an Element:\n",
    "Let's add a method to see if the tree has a value.\n",
    "Similar to before, we first create a recursive method that traverses the tree. This will be called #containsNodeRecursive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search works like this: it first compares the value to the current node, then it continues in the left or right child depending on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deleting an Element:\n",
    "The deletion is implemented similarly to finding. We need to create a recursive method to find the node. This will be called #deleteRecursive, and it takes a current Node and a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we find the node to delete, there are 3 main cases of how it'll be:\n",
    "* a node has no children: this is the simplest case. We just need to replace this node with null in its parent node.\n",
    "* a node has exactly one child: in the parent node, we replace this node with its only child.\n",
    "* a node has two children: this is the most complex case because it requires a tree reorganization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we can implement the first case when the node is a leaf node:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if(current.left == null && current.right == null){\n",
    "    return null;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's continue with the case when the node has one child:\n",
    "\n"
