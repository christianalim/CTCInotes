    "# Binary Trees\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "A tree is a data structure used to simulate, well... a tree. You can think of it as a hierarchical structure consisting of nodes that connect to other nodes in a parent/descendant kind of way. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **binary tree** is a tree data structure in which each node has **at most two children**, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. \n",
    "\n",
    "A common type of binary tree is a binary search tree, where every node has a value greater than or equal to the node values in the left sub-tree, and less than or equal to the node values in the right sub-tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation:\n",
    "A binary tree consists of nodes, so we'll have to make a Node class first, which takes a value and has left and right Nodes. This is going to be a binary search tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Operations:\n",
    "#### Inserting Elements:\n",
    "To insert an element, we're going to need to locate where we want to add a new node to keep the tree sorted. These are the following rules from the root node:\n",
    "* if the new node's value is lower than the current node's, we go to the left child\n",
    "* if the new node's value is greater than the current node's, we go to the right child.\n",
    "* when the current node is null, we've reached a leaf node and we can insert the new node in that position\n",
    "\n",
    "So first, we'll create a recursive method to do the insertion, #addRecursive. Next, we create the public method that starts the recursion from the **root** node. #add.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can use this method to create the tree from our example.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Finding an Element:\n",
    "Let's add a method to see if the tree has a value.\n",
    "Similar to before, we first create a recursive method that traverses the tree. This will be called #containsNodeRecursive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search works like this: it first compares the value to the current node, then it continues in the left or right child depending on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deleting an Element:\n",
    "The deletion is implemented similarly to finding. We need to create a recursive method to find the node. This will be called #deleteRecursive, and it takes a current Node and a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we find the node to delete, there are 3 main cases of how it'll be:\n",
    "* a node has no children: this is the simplest case. We just need to replace this node with null in its parent node.\n",
    "* a node has exactly one child: in the parent node, we replace this node with its only child.\n",
    "* a node has two children: this is the most complex case because it requires a tree reorganization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how we can implement the first case when the node is a leaf node:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if(current.left == null && current.right == null){\n",
    "    return null;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look at the case when the node has one child:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "if(current.right == null){\n",
    "    return current.left;\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "if(current.left == null){\n",
    "    return current.right;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here we are returning the non-null child so that it can be assigned to the parent node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, lets handle the case where the node has two children.\n",
    "We need to find the node to replace the deleted node. We'll use the smallest node of the node to be the deleted's right sub-tree:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "private int findSmallestValue(Node root){\n",
    "    return root.left == null ? root.value : findSmallestValue(root.left);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we take that smallest value to the node to delete, and after that we'll delete it from the right subtree:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int smallestValue = findSmallestValue(current.right);\n",
    "current.value = smallestValue;\n",
    "current.right = deleteRecursive(current.right, smallestValue);\n",
    "return current;\n",
    "\n",
    "```"
