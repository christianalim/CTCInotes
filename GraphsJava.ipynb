    "# Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph is a data structure for storing connected data. It consists of vertices and edges. A vertex represents the entity (ex: people) and an edge represents the relationship between entities (ex: people's friendships). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Directed Graph\n",
    "This type of graph has edges with a direction in them. They can have a fixed direction, with one vertex pointing to another, or be bi-directional with 2 vertices pointing to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weighted Graph\n",
    "A graph with edges that carry relative weight. This means that an edge can be weighted more or less than other edges.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Graph Representations\n",
    "## Adjacency Matrix\n",
    "An adjacency matrix is a **square matrix with dimensions equivalent to the number of vertices** in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the elements of the matrix have values 0 or 1. A value of 1 shows adjacency between the verticies in the row and column and a value of 0 otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "An adjacency matrix is easier to implement and efficient to query. However, its less efficient in terms of space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adjacency List\n",
    "An adjacency list is just an array of lists. The size of the array is equivalent to the number of vertices in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The list at a specific index of the array represents the adjacent vertices of the vertex represented by that array index.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This representation is more difficult to create and less efficient to query, however it has better space efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Graph Implementations In Java\n",
    "Java doesn't have a default implementation of the graph data structure, however we can implement the graph using Java Collections.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll define a vertex:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "    class Vertex {\n",
    "        String label;\n",
    "        Vertex(String label){\n",
    "            this.label = label;\n",
    "        }\n",
    "\n",
    "        // equals and hashCode\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "This vertex just has a label but it can represent any object. Note that we have to override the equals() and hashCode() methods because these are necessary to work with Java Collections. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, a graph is nothing but a collection of vertices and edges which can be represented as either an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how we can define this using an adjacency list:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "    class Graph{\n",
    "        private Map<Vertex, List<Vertex>> adjVertices;\n",
    "\n",
    "    }\n",
    "```"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We use Map from Java Collections to define the adjacency list. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Operations\n",
    "There are several operations possible on a graph, such as creating, updating, or searching. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define some methods to change the graph data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Methods to add or remove vertices:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "void addVertex(String label){\n",
    "    adjVertices.putIfAbsent(new Vertex(label), new ArrayList<>());\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "void removeVertex(String label){\n",
    "    Vertex v = new Vertex(label);\n",
    "    adjVertices.values().stream().forEach(e -> e.remove(v));\n",
    "    adjVertices.remove(new Vertex(label));\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods add and remove elements from the vertices Set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we define a method to add an edge:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "void addEdge(String label1, String label2){\n",
    "    Vertex v1 = new Vertex(label1);\n",
    "    Vertex v2 = new Vertex(label2);\n",
    "    adjVertices.get(v1).add(v2);\n",
    "    adjVertices.get(v2).add(v1);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "This method creates a new Edge and updates the adjacent vertices Map. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can define the removeEdge() method:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "void removeEdge(String label1, String label2){\n",
    "    Vertex v1 = new Vertex(label1);\n",
    "    Vertex v2 = new Vertex(label2);\n",
    "    List<Vertex> eV1 = adjVertices.get(v1);\n",
    "    List<Vertex> eV2 = adjVertices.get(v2);\n",
    "    if(ev1 != null) eV1.remove(v2);\n",
    "    if(ev2 != null) ev2.remove(v1);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we'll define a method to get the adjacent vertices of a particular vertex:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "List<Vertex> getAdjVertices(String label){\n",
    "    return adjVertices.get(new Vertex(label));\n",
    "}\n",
    "```"
