    "Given a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).\n",

    "The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.\n",
    "The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.\n",

    "Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thought Process\n",
    "Ok, so I know that the rules for a BST are that all the left children/subtrees must be less than root, and right children/subtrees must be greater than root. Again, since this is a tree I think the easiest solution points towards a recursive algorithm. Let's think naively, and say we have a method that checks if there is a left child, see if it's less than root. If there is a right child, see if its greater than root. Then recurse for the left and right child. If there's no root, return.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, I came back after failing a couple tries and I realized that this won't work because you can have values in the right subtree that fit the rules of left being less than root, but left could be less than the higher level root on the right side, making it invalid!"
