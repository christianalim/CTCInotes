    "## Circular Queue\n",
    "Previously, we provided a straightforward but inefficient implementation of queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more efficient way is to use a circular queue. Specifically, we may use a **fixed-size array** and **two pointers** to indicate the starting position and the ending position. The goal is to **reuse the wasted storage** we mentioned previously. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Design Circular Queue\n",
    "Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO principle and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called \"Ring Buffer\".\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the benefits of teh circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we can't insert the next element even if there is space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your implementation should support following operations:\n",
    "- MyCircularQueue(k): Constructor, set the size of the queue to be k.\n",
    "- Front: Get the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.\n",
    "- Rear: Get the lst item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.\n",
    "- enQueue(value): Insert an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful. \n",
    "- deQueue(): Delete an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.\n",
    "- isEmpty(): Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.\n",
    "- isFull(): Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "MyCircularQueue circularQueue = new MyCircularQueue(3); // set the size to be 3\n",
    "circularQueue.enQueue(1);  // return true\n",
    "circularQueue.enQueue(2);  // return true\n",
    "circularQueue.enQueue(3);  // return true\n",
    "circularQueue.enQueue(4);  // return false, the queue is full\n",
    "circularQueue.Rear();  // return 3\n",
    "circularQueue.isFull();  // return true\n",
    "circularQueue.deQueue();  // return true\n",
    "circularQueue.enQueue(4);  // return true\n",
    "circularQueue.Rear();  // return 4"
